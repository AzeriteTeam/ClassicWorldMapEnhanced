Simple addon for WoW Classic that makes the WorldMap a little easier to work with, and adds some quality of life features. It currently has no settings. 

Though the features slightly overlap, this addon is fully compatible with AzeriteUI for WoW Classic. It will enhance the map further with the additional features this addon has.

## **Features:**  
- Shrinks the WorldMap down to a manageable size.
- Prevents the WorldMap from blocking out the world visually. 
- Prevents the WorldMap from blocking user movement and input when map is visible. 
- Makes the map slightly transparent when the player is moving, to easier spot mobs and hostile players. 
- Shows player- and mouse cursor coordinates.
